                <p>
                  I had an admittedly rough start. I was adopted at two years old by a Caucasian, lesbian couple, which obviously contributed
                  to a... unique experience growing up. I love them and my brother (by blood:we were a package deal, haha) more than anything else
                  in this life. That said, my lack of role models (both male and black) led me down a confusing path, which ultimately had me
                  being an active gang member and drug dealer. Only when I began to work, at the age of sixteen, did I receive the mentorship I needed
                  to start to mature into a man of substance. I've always bugged my managers into taking me under their wings, haha. Because of
                  this, I gained the skills necessary to be given a managerial title in the restaurant industry by nineteen years old. A title I maintained
                  until my recent pilgrimage into the tech industry.

                  In just 6 months I went from a novice to experienced enough to build 7 web apps from the bottom
                  up while honing the ability to work in a team setting for the benefit of the current project. It was during this chrysalis-like
                  stage in my development as an engineer that I fell completely smitten with the minutiae of this industry. Synthesizing
                  low-latency recursive algorithms, cleaning up messy codebases with object-oriented programing (to keep them as D.R.Y as
                  possible), painstakingly testing responsive web designs, B.I.F.I.R (Break It, Fix It, Repeat) as many times as it takes
                  to make it right. These are all skills that I have far from perfected, but my progress in their regard has been
                  personally breath-taking and I know that my infatuation with them will bring me as close to perfection as I can
                  get.

                  Though I <i>am</i> young and excited to work in any sector of the industry, I dream of working my way up to being on the cutting
                  edge of A.I. development in the next ten years. That and robotics programming are fields that excite me to the core in an inexplicable
                  way. Ever the innovator, I think the chance to make a mark in a young technology that will undoubtedly drive the development of human
                  civilization forward is all but irresistible to me. I've already purchased Udemy courses on machine learning and C/C++ because, as I
                  understand it, that is the industry-standard production language in that sector. I am fully prepared to spend that decade pushing the
                  envelope at a company while utilizing my free time to return to school and independently learn the skills necessary to make my dream come true!

              I am a Software Engineer! Wow, that feels so great to say after quitting my stable job as a Kitchen
              Manager, spending 4 months grinding 12+ hrs a day in the General Assembly Bootcamp, and working since then to polish my
              portfolio, teach myself new skills, and apply to positions. In 6 months I built 7 web apps from the bottom
              up, getting comfortable working in a team setting for the benefit of the current project. It was during this chrysalis-like

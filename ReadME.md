# Thank You For Checking Out My Portfolio!

I've deployed this, with the help of Netlify, to [www.samanhg.com](https://www.samanhg.com). I decided to go for a fun and playful feeling for my first portfolio because it best reflects my personality. I implemented reCaptcha because my business contact information is accessible on this site. Like most software engineering skills I teach myself, I initially overcomplicated the process and then saw that it was actually *super* easy. I also implemented a handy regular expression to check if the user is on a mobile device that I found on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3514784/what-is-the-best-way-to-detect-a-mobile-device). This made it easier to make the site more responsive and user-friendly. Another cool trick I did for the first time was to use the `date` object to discern the user's local time. That was the key to auto-setting my theme, as well as the greeting on the home page. All-in-all a very fun site to make. I still can't believe the amount of progress I've made. It was stunning how easy it was to go back to React.js and Redux after spending a while honing my skills with Nuxt.js and Python. Please, let me know what you think, good or bad. I realize that I'm still learning, so any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saman-khaliq/).
